# Brainfuck interpreter written in C

This is a simple interpreter for the Brainfuck programming language (https://github.com/brain-lang/brainfuck/blob/master/brainfuck.md) written in C.

## Building
```bash
./build.sh
```

## Usage
```bash
./interpreter <filepath of Brainfuck source code>
```

## TODO
- Fix error detection for the case when no matching bracket is found.

## Considerations
The "Hello world" example was taken from The Renegade Coder (Jeremy Grifski) at https://therenegadecoder.com/code/hello-world-in-brainfuck/.
